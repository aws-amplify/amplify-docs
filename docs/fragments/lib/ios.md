## FAQs

### How are these different from the AWS Mobile SDK for iOS?
The Amplify iOS client libraries are use-case centric whereas the AWS Mobile SDK for iOS is service-centric. This enables you to focus on your use-case more rather than figuring out the AWS service nuances. The Amplify libraries provide a highly abstracted category based programming model. You can also use the Mobile SDK with the Amplify libraries using escape hatches if the use case you are trying to build is not currently available in Amplify libraries.

### Do I have to use the AWS Mobile SDK when using the Amplify Libraries for iOS?
No. The AWS Mobile SDK for iOS is not a dependency to use Amplify Libraries for iOS.
