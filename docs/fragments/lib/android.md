## FAQs

### How are these different from the AWS Mobile SDK for Android?
The Amplify Android client libraries are use-case centric whereas the AWS Mobile SDK for Android is service-centric. This enables you to focus on your use-case more rather than figuring out the AWS service nuances. The Amplify libraries provide a highly abstracted category based programming model. You can also use the Mobile SDK with the Amplify libraries using escape hatches if the use case you are trying to build is not currently available in Amplify libraries.

> Currently, the Amplify Libraries for Android are in preview and the existing AWS Mobile SDK for Android are GA.

### Do I have to use the AWS Mobile SDK when using the Amplify Libraries for Android?
No. The AWS Mobile SDK for Android is not a dependency to use Amplify Libraries for Android.
