## FAQs

### How is the AWS Mobile SDK for Android different from the Amplify Libraries for Android?

The Amplify client libraries are use-case centric whereas the Mobile SDK is service-centric. The Amplify libraries provide a highly abstracted category based programming model. You can also use the Mobile SDK with the Amplify libraries using escape hatches if the use case you are trying to build is not available in Amplify libraries.

Currently, the Amplify Libraries for Android are in preview and the existing AWS Mobile SDK for Android is production-ready.

This guide shows how to build an app using AWS Mobile SDK for Android and the Amplify CLI toolchain. To use our new, preview developer experience refer to the [Amplify Libraries for Android guide](~/lib/lib.md).
