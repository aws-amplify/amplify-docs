The API (GraphQL) category provides a solution for making HTTP requests to GraphQL endpoints.

## GraphQL

AWS AppSync helps you build data-driven apps with real-time and offline capabilities. The [Amplify API Plugin](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ios) enables you to integrate your app with the AWS AppSync service. The framework supports multiple authorization models, handles subscription handshake protocols for real-time updates to data, and has built-in capabilities for offline support that makes it easy to integrate into your app.

The AWS Amplify API module supports AWS AppSync or any other GraphQL backends.

## Using AWS AppSync

AWS AppSync helps you build data-driven apps with real-time and offline capabilities. Learn more about [AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/) by visiting [AWS AppSync Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/welcome.html).


The Amplify Framework offers two client options for AppSync:

- [Amplify GraphQL client](#amplify-graphql-client)

- [GraphQL](#graphql)
- [Using AWS AppSync](#using-aws-appsync)

The Amplify GraphQL client is a light weight option if you're looking for a simple way to leverage GraphQL features and do not need the offline capabilities or caching. If you need those features, please look at [Amplify DataStore](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/js/datastore).

Alternatively the [AWS AppSync SDK](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-mobile-appsync-sdk-js/) enables you to integrate your app with the AWS AppSync service and integrates with the Apollo client found [here](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/).
