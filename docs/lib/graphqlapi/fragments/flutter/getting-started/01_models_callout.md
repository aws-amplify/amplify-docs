Amplify Flutter currently supports the advanced workflow for GraphQL which involves constructing custom requests by providing a GraphQL document and variables.

Model based APIs that will generate a GraphQL request for you under the covers will be supported in the future.

You can learn more about the structure of a request from [GraphQL Query Language](https://graphql.org/learn/) and [AppSync documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/graphql-overview.html). To test out constructing your own requests, open the AppSync console using `amplify console api` and navigate to the Queries tab.
