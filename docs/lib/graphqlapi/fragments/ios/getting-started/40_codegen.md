## Generate Todo Model class

To generate the `Todo` model, change directories to your project folder and **execute the command**:

```bash
amplify codegen models
```

The generated files will be under the `amplify/generated/models` directory. 
```
AmplifyModels.swift
Todo.swift
Todo+Schema.swift
```
Drag and place the entire `models` directory into Xcode to add them to your project.
