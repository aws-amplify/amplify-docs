## Update the schema

Edit the schema and re-run `amplify codegen models`.

```graphql
enum PostStatus {
  ACTIVE
  INACTIVE
  STAGED # new enum value
}

type Post @model {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  rating: Int!
  status: PostStatus!
}
```

This will evaluate the changes and create a versioned hash if any changes are detected which impact the underlying on-device storage structure. For example, types being added/deleted or fields becoming required/optional. DataStore evaluates this version on startup and if there are changes the local items on device will be removed and a full sync from AppSync will take place if you are syncing with the cloud.

### Migrations

Local migrations on device are not supported. If you are syncing with the cloud the structure and items of that data in your DynamoDB table will not be touched as part of this process.
