### Add the API plugin

DataStore's cloud synchronization uses the [API category](~/lib/graphqlapi/getting-started.md) behind the scenes. Therefore, the first step is to add an API plugin.

Make sure that you declare a dependency on the DataStore plugin in your app-level pubspec.yaml:

```yaml
TBD
```

Next, add the plugin in your Amplify initialization code alongside with the previously added `AWSDataStorePlugin`.


```dart
TBD
```
