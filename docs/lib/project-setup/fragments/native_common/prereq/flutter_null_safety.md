If you are using Flutter (2.2.0 or greater), you need to disable sound null safety by following the instructions [here](https://dart.dev/null-safety/unsound-null-safety#testing-or-running-mixed-version-programs). Another option is to update the `pubspec.yaml` as below

```
environment:
  sdk: ">=2.11.0 <3.0.0"
``` 

Null safety support for Amplify Flutter is actively being worked on.
