**Open AppDelegate.swift** and add `import Amplify` at the top of the file:
```swift
import Amplify
```

**Update the following function** to verify that Amplify can be compiled into your project:
```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    do {
        try Amplify.configure()
    } catch {
        print("An error occurred setting up Amplify: \(error)")
    }
    return true
}
```

Build your project (`Cmd+b`).  If your build succeeeds, then you have successfully added the Amplify library to your project.  If you run the application, you should not see any errors being printed to the console.

<amplify-callout>

If Xcode reports build errors like `Undefined symbol: _OBJC_CLASS_$_AWSSignatureV4Signer`, as shown in the screenshot below, clean build folder with **Product > Clean Build Folder** (`Shift+Cmd+K`) and rebuild the project (`Cmd+b`).

</amplify-callout>

Optionally, if you'd like to see additional log messages of what amplify is doing during configuration, you can turn on verbose logging by adding the following line of code:
```swift
Amplify.Logging.logLevel = .verbose
```

Re-running the application with verbose logging on, you will see the following messages:
```console
[Amplify] Configuring
[Amplify] Configuration: nil
```
