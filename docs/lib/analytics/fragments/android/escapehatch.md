For advanced use cases where Amplify does not provide the functionality, you can retrieve the escape hatch to access the underlying Amazon Pinpoint client.

<amplify-block name="Java">

```java
AWSPinpointAnalyticsPlugin plugin = (AWSPinpointAnalyticsPlugin) Amplify
        .Analytics
        .getPlugin("awsPinpointAnalyticsPlugin");
AnalyticsClient analyticsClient = plugin.getEscapeHatch();
```

</amplify-block>
<amplify-block name="Kotlin">

```kotlin
val plugin = Amplify.Analytics.getPlugin("awsPinpointAnalyticsPlugin")
val analyticsClient = (plugin as AWSPinpointAnalyticsPlugin).escapeHatch
```
