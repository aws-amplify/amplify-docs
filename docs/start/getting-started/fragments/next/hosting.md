### Options 2: Follow the instructions

Create __serverless.yml__ with the following content:

```yaml
# serverless.yml
nextamplified:
  component: "@sls-next/serverless-component@1.16.0"
```

Finally, deploy with the following command:

```bash
npx serverless
```

You'll see a link to your app in the output:

```console
  nextamplified:
    appUrl:         https://‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢.cloudfront.net
    bucketName:     XXXXXX-XXXXXXX
    distributionId: XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

> **Note**: Your CloudFront Distribution may take several minutes to go from "In Progress" to "Active".  Visit your [CloudFront Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/home) to monitor progress.

üëè Congratulations, your app is online!

To delete the app, run the following:

```bash
npx serverless remove
```
