## What we'll build

In this tutorial you'll use the Authentication, Storage, and Analytics categories of the Flutter-Amplify SDK to create a very simple photo storage app.  

You will use **Authentication** to allow the user to sign up, sign in, and sign out with [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/). 

Once the user is logged in, you will use **Storage** to load, display, and upload images to [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). 

Lastly, you'll use **Analytics** to track user actions in [Amazon Pinpoint](https://aws.amazon.com/pinpoint/).
