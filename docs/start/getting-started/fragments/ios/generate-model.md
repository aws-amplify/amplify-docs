With the basic setup complete, next you will model the data your application will store. Amplify DataStore will use this model to persist data to your local device will be synchronized to a backend API without writing any additional code. These models are specified as [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) schemas. If you'd like, first [learn more](~/cli/graphql-transformer/overview.md) about GraphQL schemas and data modeling.

1. In Xcode, from the project navigation tab (Cmd+1), **open the schema file** located at **AmplifyConfig** > **schema.graphql**.  In your project folder, this is located at: `"amplify/backend/api/amplifyDatasource/schema.graphql"`.

    Replace the contents of the file with the following schema:

    ```graphql
   enum Priority {
     LOW
     NORMAL
     HIGH
   }

   type Todo @model {
     id: ID!
     name: String!
     priority: Priority
     description: String
   }
    ```

    This schema creates a model called `Todo` with four properties:

    - **id** an auto-generated identifier field for a Todo item
    - **name** a non-optional string field that is the title of the Todo item
    - **priority** an optional enumeration type field that indicates the importance of a Todo item; the value of priority can be only *LOW*, *NORMAL*, or *HIGH*
    - **description** an optional string field that holds more information about a Todo item

1. Next, generate the classes for these models. **Update the amplifytools.xcconfig file** and change `modelgen=false` to:
  ```bash
  modelgen=true
  ```

1. **Build the project (Cmd+b)**.  Doing a build will invoke Amplify tools to generate the following swift files, and automatically add them to your project in a folder called "AmplifyModels".  These generated files will be compiled on the next time you build your project.
    ```bash
    $ ls amplify/generated/models/
    AmplifyModels.swift
    Priority.swift
    Todo+Schema.swift
    Todo.swift
    ```
    Note that when Amplify tools needs to update your project, this may disrupt the Xcode's build process, and leave the build in a canceled or error state.  If your project ends up in either of these states due to amplify tools needing to make updates to your project, you can just build again (`Cmd+b`) re-issue a build for the updated project.

    <amplify-callout>

    If Xcode reports build errors like `Undefined symbol: _OBJC_CLASS_$_AWSSignatureV4Signer`, as shown in the screenshot below, clean build folder with **Product > Clean Build Folder** (`Shift+Cmd+K`) and rebuild the project (`Cmd+b`).

    </amplify-callout>

1. Now that Amplify tools has added the generated models to your project, you will need to **issue another build (`Cmd+b`)** to compile the newly generated files
