ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! In this tutorial, you will:

- Set up an iOS application configured with Amplify
- Create a data model and perist data to Amplify DataStore
- Connect your local data to synchronize to a cloud backend

## Prerequisites

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 10 or higher
- Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/) version 10.2 or later
- Install [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)

- Install [Amplify CLI](~/cli/cli.md) version 4.21.0 or later by running:

    ```bash
    npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
    ```

## Set up your application

### Create a new iOS application
1.  **Open Xcode.**  From the menu bar, select **"File -> New -> Project..."**

1.  Select **Single View App**, select **Next**

1.  Fill in the following for your project:
  * Product Name: **Todo**
  * Langauge: **Swift**
  * User Interface: **SwiftUI**
  * **Tap `Next`**

  ![](~/images/lib/getting-started/ios/set-up-ios-studio-configure-your-project.png)

1.  After tapping Next, **select where you would like to save your project**, then **tap Create**.

  You should now have an empty iOS project without Amplify.

### Add Amplify to your application

Amplify for iOS is distribued through Cocoapods as a Pod. In this section, you'll setup cocoa pods and add the required Amplify packages.

1.  Before starting this step, please make sure that please **close Xcode.**

  **Open a terminal** and **change directories to your project**.  For example, if you created your project in the folder `~/Developer`, you can:
  ```bash
  cd ~/Developer/Todo
  ```

1.  In order to initialize your project with the CocoaPods package manager, **execute the command**:
  ```bash
  pod init
  ```

  After doing this, you should see a newly created file called `Podfile`.  This file is used to describe what packages your project depends on.

1.  **Update the file** to include the following pods:
  ```
  target 'Todo' do
      use_frameworks!

      pod 'Amplify'
      pod 'Amplify/Tools'
      pod 'AmplifyPlugins/AWSAPIPlugin'
      pod 'AmplifyPlugins/AWSDataStorePlugin'

  end
  ```

1.  To download and install the Amplify pod into your project, **execute the command**:
  ```bash
  pod install --repo-update
  ```

1.  After doing this, you should now see file called `Todo.xcworkspace`.  You are required to use this file from now on instead of the .xcodeproj file.  To open your workspace, **execute the command**:
  ```bash
  xed .
  ```
This should open the newly generated Todo.xcworkspace in Xcode.

### Adding Amplify tools
We will now add AmplifyTools as a build phase in your project.  
1.  Click on the **Todo project** in the project workspace, then click the **Todo** app target, and then **click on `Build Phases`**.

1.  Tap the `+` button to add another phase, and **select "New Run Script Phase"**
  ![](~/images/lib/getting-started/ios/set-up-ios-amplify-tools-2.png)

1.  Drag the new `Run Script` phase to move the phase so that it runs prior to the `Compile Sources` phase.

1.  Update the `Run Script` build phase title to **"Run Amplify Tools"**, and then update the shell script to have a single line with:
  ```bash
  "${PODS_ROOT}/AmplifyTools/amplify-tools.sh"
  ```
  Your project should now look like this.  Notice that the amplify tools phase comes before the Compile Sources phase.

1.  Now that we've added Amplify tools to the build process, it will run when you build you project.  **Build your project** in Xcode (`Cmd+b`).  Because this is the first time you are buliding your project, Amplify tools will detect this and generate a number of files in your project directory.
  * `amplify` (folder) - Contains a number of configuration files and pre-generated sample files that we will be using in you project
  * `amplifytools.xcconfig` - this configuration file controls the behavior of amplify tools
  * `amplifyconfiguration.json` - this configuration file will be added to your project and shipped with your bundle.  This is required by the amplify libraries.
  * `awsconfiguration.json` - this configuration file will also be added to your poject and shipped with your bundle.  This is also requried by the amplify libraries.
    
You are ready to start building with Amplify! ðŸŽ‰

<amplify-callout>

If Xcode reports build errors like `Undefined symbol: _OBJC_CLASS_$_AWSSignatureV4Signer`, as shown in the screenshot below, clean build folder with **Product > Clean Build Folder** (`Shift+Cmd+K`) and rebuild the project (`Cmd+b`).
