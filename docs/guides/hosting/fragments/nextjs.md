In this guide you'll learn how to deploy a *static* [Next](https://nextjs.org/) app using Amplify Hosting.

> Note: Next also supports pre-rendering for *dynamic* server-rendered routes. At this time, Amplify **does not** support the hosting of dynamic server-rendered routes with Next.

There are two options: One using the Amplify CLI, and the other using a Git repository. This will cover both.

1. [CLI workflow](#cli-workflow)
2. [Git-based workflow](#git-based-deployments)

## CLI workflow

To get started, create a new Next site:

```sh
$ npm init next-app

✔ What is your project named? my-app
✔ Pick a template › Default starter app
```

Next, change into the new directory and update __package.json__ to add the `export` script to the existing `build` script:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build && next export",
  "start": "next start"
},
```

> `next export` allows you to export your app to static HTML, which can be run standalone without the need of a Node.js server.

### Adding Amplify hosting

If you haven't already, install and configure the latest version of the Amplify CLI:

```sh
$ npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli

$ amplify configure
```

> To see a video walkthrough of how to configure the CLI, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWbM5DLh25U).

Next, initialize a new Amplify project. __Make sure you set the Distribution Directory Path to `out`__.

```sh
$ amplify init

? Enter a name for the project: mynextapp
? Enter a name for the environment: dev
? Choose your default editor: Visual Studio Code (or your preferred editor)
? Choose the type of app that youre building: javascript
? What javascript framework are you using: react
? Source Directory Path: src
? Distribution Directory Path: out
? Build Command: npm run-script build
? Start Command: npm run-script start
? Do you want to use an AWS profile? Y
? Please choose the profile you want to use: <your profile>
```

Now, add hosing with the Amplify `add` command:

```sh
$ amplify add hosting

? Select the plugin module to execute: Hosting with Amplify Console
? Choose a type: Manual deployment
```

Next, deploy the app:

```sh
$ amplify publish

? Are you sure you want to continue? Yes
```

⚡️ Congratulations, your app has now been successfully deployed! The URL for the app should be displayed in your terminal.

To see your app in the Amplify console at any time, run the following command:

```sh
$ amplify console
```

### Deploying updates

Once you make changes to your app and are ready to deploy them, you can run the `publish` command again:

```sh
$ amplify publish
```

### Deleting the app

To delete the app and the deployment, run the `delete` command:

```sh
$ amplify delete
```

## Git-based deployments

Amplify also offers Git-based deployments with features like CI/CD and branch previews.

To host using a Git-based deployment, follow these steps instead.

__1.__ Create your app

```sh
$ npm init next-app

✔ What is your project named? my-app
✔ Pick a template › Default starter app
```

__2.__ Set the following custom `build` script in your package.json:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build && next export",
  "start": "next start"
},
```

__3.__ Create a Git repository, then push your code to Git.

```sh
$ git init
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:username/my-next-app.git
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'initial commit'
$ git push origin master
```

__4.__ Go to the [Amplify Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify) and click "Connect App"

__5.__ Follow the steps to choose your Git provider and your branch.

__6.__ Set the __baseDirectory__ to __out__:

__7.__ Click __Next__ then __Save and deploy__.

Once your site has successfully deployed, you should see three green checkmarks.

To view the live site, click on the automatically generated URL given to you by the Amplify Console.

### Kicking off a new build

You can kick off a new build directly from the Amplify console or by pushing changes to master.

1. Make some changes to your code

2. Push the changes to git

```sh
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'updates'
$ git push origin master
```

## Dynamic server-rendered routes

In this guide you learned how to deploy a static __Next__ site using Amplify Hosting.

Next also supports pre-rendering for dynamic server-rendered routes. At this time, Amplify does not support the hosting of dynamic server-rendered routes with Next.
